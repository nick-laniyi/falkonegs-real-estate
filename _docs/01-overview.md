# Project Overview: Falkonegs Property Portal

## Client Background

Falkonegs LTD is a Nigerian property investment company based in Lekki, Lagos. They needed a professional online presence to showcase their properties and generate leads.

## Business Requirements

**Must Have:**
- Property listings with images and details
- Search and filter functionality
- Contact forms for inquiries
- Mobile-friendly design
- Admin panel for content updates

**Nice to Have:**
- User accounts with saved properties
- Property comparison feature
- Inquiry tracking system
- Featured properties on homepage

## My Approach

I built a custom solution rather than using WordPress or other CMS platforms because:
1. Client needed specific functionality not available in templates
2. Better performance and security control
3. No ongoing licensing fees
4. Complete ownership of codebase
5. Easier to add custom features later

## Current Status

The site launched in December 2025 and is actively managed by the client. New properties are added weekly through the admin panel.
